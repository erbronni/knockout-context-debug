Sample Attribute Binding
========================

This is a quick project to test out the StackOverflow question: 
[data binding aria label not working on button tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35214371/data-binding-aria-label-not-working-on-button-tag?noredirect=1#comment58155528_35214371).

To see the sample, run the following commands to install the dependencies:

    npm install
    bower install
    
Then open the ```index.html``` file in Chrome and inspect the button element.  It should look something like the screen shot below:
